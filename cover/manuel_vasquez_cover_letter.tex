    I am a passionate Software Engineer who lives to solve problems. I have been coding ever since I first discovered Lua while playing Roblox. Most of my time outside of work and school is spent discovering new technologies, like the recent Serverless framework.
    \vspace*{.49cm}

    Although programming is my passion, I also have other hobbies like long-distance cycling and rock climbing. I have ridden all over Florida, from Blue Springs to Tampa and from South Beach to Jupiter.
    \vspace*{.49cm}

    I am also excited to say that I am now a true entrepreneur. I have been busy launching a stock trading social media called Imperium Analytics. We are almost ready to launch our Discord server and the alpha version of our mobile application. This application will provide a safe crowd-sourced learning ecosystem for anyone interested in learning about trading.

    Although the latter does take up a good chunk of my time, I am also an active member of the Kaggle community. Given that another one of my passions is Statistics, I find joy in participating in these Data Science competitions and quantitatively watching my skills grow via their leaderboards.

    I would be a great asset for \company $ $ given that I am a hard worker and a team player. I am always looking for the next challenge and \company $ $ can definitely provide an infinite amount of challenging problems for me to solve. I have been able to grow and prove my software engineering skills at Siemens and I would like to continue this trend at \company. Joining \company $ $ would greatly increase my ability to learn and grow within my field. 
    \vspace*{.49cm}

    I appreciate your time and I look forward to hearing from you regarding the next steps!
