    Hi \company,
    \vspace*{.49cm}

    I am a passionate Software Engineer who loves to solve problems. Being born and raised in the Dominican Republic, my surroundings have helped me develop a sense of creativity and imagination. As a child, this is where I first discovered Lua while playing Roblox. Most of my time outside of work and school is spent discovering new technologies and doing activities outdoors, like long-distance cycling and rock climbing.

    Working at Siemens has allowed me to hone and prove my software engineering skills; this knowledge has greatly helped me co-found a startup called Imperium Analytics. We are building an application that will provide a safe crowd-sourced learning ecosystem for anyone interested in learning about trading. I am excited to say that we are about to launch our Discord server and the alpha version of the mobile application.

    Given that my passions also include Statistics and Data Science, I manage my time to be an active member of the Kaggle community by participating in these Data Science competitions. It brings me joy to watch my skills grow via their leaderboards.

    I would be a great asset for \company $ $ given that I am a hard worker, team player, and an empathetic person who understands various cultures. Since looking for the next challenge and getting challenged is something I am actively seeking, being a part of your team would be a great opportunity for me to grow within my field and learn from other professionals.
    \vspace*{.49cm}

    Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the next steps!
    \vspace*{1cm}

    Best regards,
