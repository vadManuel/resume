To Whom It May Concern,

Hello, my name is Manuel. I will be graduating from UCF this Spring semester from Computer Science and a minor in Statistics.

Joining Google has been a goal of mine since high school. I believe I can be great asset given my current achievements at my current position within Siemens. I have developed several production level applications that are being used by hundreds of users daily. At the same time I continued to make my way into the data science community via Kaggle. These are some of the reasons I believe I am capable to work at Google.

These are the positions I am interested in fulfilling in order of preference.

These are the positions I would prefer to prioritize, but I understand that they have certain degree of professional experience required.
