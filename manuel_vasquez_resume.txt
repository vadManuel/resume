UCF101-Sports dataset action recognition
Utilized Google's Inception network to extract features and passed them to an RNN in order to maintain spatiotemporal information. Due to the size of the dataset, I used LOO cross-validation and achieved a validation accuracy of 72.87% on the 10 different actions.

DJI Tello active hand tracking and gesture recognition
Gave the Tello drone the ability to be controlled via hand gestures: index finger on right hand pointing up/down means climb/drop 20cm per second and if the right hand is open the drone will move in an attempt to always keep the palm of the hand in the center of its field of view.

KnightyKnights.com a MERN stack contact manager
Our team was comprised of 5 members and had 20 days to build a fully working deployed website, we chose to build it using the MERN stack. As the team project manager, I implemented the Agile methodology in order to accept changes that might come later on. In order to speed up the building phase of each step we all learned each component of the stack and branched our submissions on Github.

MNIST dataset handwritten digit recognition
Using a ConvNet achieved 99.23% validation accuracy using a 30% validation set. Trained with SGD (learning rate=0.1) with a total of 60 epochs, mini-batch size of 10, and Dropout (rate=0.5) for regularization.

Kinetics-600 dataset action recognition using I3D
A recent project in which I move forward from older technologies. I attempt to decompose and re-engineer the Two-Stream Inflated 3D ConvNet created by Carreira and Zisserman.

Dynamically aimed refreshments cooler with skeleton tracking
A current project where I use optical flow to lower the computational cost of tracking more than a single skeleton with a Kinect V2. The project's objective is to track the user, count the number of fingers they are holding up and launch a can from the appropriate compartment to the user at a variable distance.

***** Clubs, Activities, and Certification *****
UCF Robotics Club - Laki2 Drone Payload Delivery Team
This drone is the Robotics Club's first entry into the AUVSI SUAS competition. My task in this project was to create shape and character recognition models. We ran into data issues from the beginning since all we had was artificially created pictures of the landscape, so I was also tasked with creating an image generator as a method to train the relaxed shape and character recognition models.

AI@UCF - Fall and Spring semester Coordinator position candidate
- Intelligence: We were tasked with reading and analysis a research paper weekly. Once a week we met to discuss issues, questions, and simply what we thought about the paper.
- Course: The club met once a week to discuss and implement practical applications of the current week's topic. We would then code up working examples once Google Colab.

UCF Programming Team: Members meet every Saturday morning for a 2-hour lecture and 4-hour mock contest.
