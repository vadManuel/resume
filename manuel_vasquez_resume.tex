    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.35cm]
        \item \textbf{UCF101-Sports dataset action recognition} \\
        Utilized Google's Inception network to extract features and passed them to an RNN
        in order to maintain spatiotemporal information. Due to the size of the dataset, I
        used LOO cross-validation and achieved a validation accuracy of 72.87\% on the 10
        different actions.
        \item \textbf{DJI Tello active hand tracking} \\
        Gave a Tello drone the ability to be controlled by the palm of a single user. Utilizing
        the 11k Hands database by Mahmoud, I was able to train a model to track the palm of the
        user. I am currently working on a deep belief network which returns keypoints in the hand
        utilizing the bounded image from the palm detector. The drone maintains the palm of the user centered in its field of view.
        \item \textbf{\textit{KnightyKnights.com} a fitness tracker} \\
        Our team was comprised of 5 members and had 30 days to build a mobile application and a web
        counterpart. We utilized Firebase's Firestore as our database and React to build the client
        side of our website. The mobile application was built using iOS's Swift language as well as
        Google's Firebase libraries. Our fitness tracker on the app side is able to track a user's
        workout via GPS, show the user a map of their current location as well as various statistics,
        show a live feed of friended posts, participate in competitions, earn coins, and other features.
        The web side contains all of what the mobile app contains and many statistics regarding user and
        friends workouts.
        \item \textbf{Dynamically aimed refreshments cooler with skeleton tracking} \\
        A current project where I use optical flow to lower the computational cost of tracking
        more than a single skeleton with a Kinect V2. The project's objective is to track the
        user, count the number of fingers they are holding up and launch a can from the
        appropriate compartment to the user at a variable distance.
        \item \textbf{Kaggle Competitions - Data} \\
        I've trained and deployed several models utilizing datasets provided in competitions, including:
        New Your City Airbnb Open Data, PGA Tour Golf Data, Crimes in Boston, Electric Motor Temperature,
        and several others.
        \item \textbf{MNIST dataset handwritten digit recognition} \\
        Using a ConvNet achieved 99.23\% validation accuracy using a 30\% validation set.
        Trained with SGD (learning rate=0.1) with a total of 60 epochs, mini-batch size of 10,
        and Dropout (rate=0.5) for regularization.

        \begin{itemize}[$\circ$]
            % \item \textbf{Intelligence:} We were tasked with reading and analysing a research
            % paper weekly. Once a week we met to discuss issues, questions, or simply what we
            % thought about the paper.
            \item \textbf{Core:} Honing and reviewing AI/ML and Data Science in general.
            \item \textbf{Data Science:} A project-based stem of the AI@UCF club that focuses
            on honing industry skills through real-world application. We explore untouched
            datasets, and make new discoveries as they relate to the fields of AI, ML, and
            Data Science in general.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{UCF Robotics Club} Laki2 Drone Payload Delivery Team \\
        This drone is the Robotics Club's first entry into the AUVSI SUAS competition. My task
        in this project was to create shape and character recognition models. We ran into data
        issues from the beginning since all we had was artificially created pictures of the
        landscape, so I was also tasked with creating an image generator as a method to train
        the relaxed shape and character recognition models.
        \item \textbf{UCF Programming Team:} Members meet every Saturday morning for a 2-hour lecture
        and 4-hour mock contest.
